# 3DModeling
A simple project that illustrates foundations of working with 3D Graphics. Here are implemented all possible transformations ( rotation, moving, scaling ). Also there are number of algorithm for eliminating invisible lines and surfaces. Some simple algorithms for light. DirectX is used for layout. (GDI is also supported).
